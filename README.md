Recently, the Federal Reserve, the US central bank has been increasing the interest rates to stabilize the economy. Since March of 2022 the rate change (bps) has been increased 8 times. 

The Fed was created to help the United States economy run smoothly by monitoring several economic indicators, such as inflation, unemployment, consumer prices, and gross domestic product (GDP). The increasing rates are affecting all of us. Rate hikes generally mean higher credit card rates, higher interest on car and loans, and even mortgages. 

Our goal for this project is to analyze how interest rate hikes and drops impact the economy. 

For this analysis we used FRED to extract data. Data was from 1940s to 2022.  FRED is short for Federal Reserve Economic Data. Itâ€™s an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources database. We performed an API call to extract the data.
