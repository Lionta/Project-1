## Backround
Recently, the Federal Reserve, the US central bank has been increasing the interest rates to stabilize the economy. Since March of 2022 the rate change (bps) has been increased 8 times. The Fed was created to help the United States economy run smoothly by monitoring several economic indicators, such as inflation, unemployment, consumer prices, and gross domestic product (GDP). The increasing rates are affecting all of us. Rate hikes generally mean higher credit card rates, higher interest on car and loans, and even mortgages. 

Our goal for this project is to analyze how interest rate hikes and drops impact the economy. 

## Methodology
For this analysis we used FRED to extract data. Data was from 1940s to 2022.  FRED is short for Federal Reserve Economic Data. It’s an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources. 

# Analysis
## Intrest Rate vs GDP

This graph is of the two data frames merged (interest rate and GDP) from 1940s to 2022. GDP is trending upward. Interest rates fluctuates throughout the years. It was the highest in the 1980s at around 19%. At first glance it seems as though there is no relationship between the two variables but as we look closer, we notice that between 1940s to 1990 GDP was growing at a slower rate when compared to 1990 to 2022. At the same time interest rates grew significantly from 1940s to 1990s and then started decreasing. The average GDP annual growth rate from 1962 to 1981 was 1%. While the average GDP annual growth rate from 1982 to 2021 was 8%. 

In contrast, the average interest rates from 1962 to 1981 was 6.59%. While the average interest rate from 1982 to 2021.  The data suggest that when the Feds started aggressively decreasing the interest rates the GDP grew at a higher rate.

To see how closely the two variables relate to one another we performed a linear regression. The correlation coefficient r is 0.5. This supports the conclusion that there is a weak to moderate linear relationship between GDP and interest rates. Higher interest rates can slow down the economy.

DONE!!!!!
